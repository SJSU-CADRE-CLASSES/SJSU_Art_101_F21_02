            <p> <strong> What is this?</strong><br>As someone who likes to draw, sometimes I have the artist's block. I need some drawing prompts. <br>
        This is the project that generates some drawing prompts randomly. It is made for people who like some new and interesting challenges and inspirations for their artwork!<br>
      There's no rule to draw the prompts. These prompts are just made for you to spread your creativity.<br>
    Click "Start here" to explore! </p>
